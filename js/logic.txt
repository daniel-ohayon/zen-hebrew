when we input a new letter:
- if there is an open popup (selectedIndex not null):
	- if the caret has moved:
		hide popup and continue as if no popup
	- if we strike the same input as before:
		replace the last letter and change the highlighted letter in the popup
	- if we strike a different letter:
		hide popup (selectedIndex <- 0) and continue as if no popup
- if there is no popup (selectedIndex == null):
	- if we strike an unrecognized character:
		- if it is a punctuation mark, add it and change final letter if needed
		- otherwise, do not override output
	- if we strike a single-mapping letter, display it
	- if we strike a multi-mapping letter, display first mapping and display popup
